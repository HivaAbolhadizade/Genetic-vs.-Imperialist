# Genetic-vs.-Imperialist
This repository contains implementations of genetic algorithms (GAs) and the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA), two powerful techniques for optimization and problem-solving. Dive into the code to understand the inner workings of these algorithms and compare their performance across various problem domains.
